How the answer is figured out?

It should be straightforward to find the redundant computations if simulating the problem on a paper for a period of
time. Although the editoral says to be a dynamic programming, it is more like a subtle lazy evaluation during
enumerating the cells. Instead, we can try to compute an array offline from the enumeration, which could be easier to
understand.
